# Blackjack-Python
A blackjack program made in Python that utilizes Object Oriented Programming to organize player money, the deck, and the player and dealer hands.
The program also utilizes user input for bet money, if they would like to play again, and whether to hit or stand.
Please note that for this version of Blackjack, a non-Blackjack 21 and a Blackjack 21 are treated equally.
